SIB: use to provide some information before we get into actual logic, basically used to initialize static variable of the class
	- it will be executed before main method, as we don't have any name for this
	- without main() SIB won't be executed
	- if we have more dn one SIB dn all the SIB will be executed in sequential order before main()
block-- no name, no return type, no calling
